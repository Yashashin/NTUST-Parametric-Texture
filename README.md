# Parametric Texture
基礎電腦圖學Project3

- OpenMesh is a data structure for meshes that provides numerous functions and data to obtain information about faces, edges, and vertices.
- In this project, by utilizing OpenMesh's storage format and API, it's possible to solve linear systems to obtain texture coordinates for mesh vertices. These can then be parametrically applied to various textures onto corresponding meshes, supporting rich functionality such as brush size adjustments, color changes, file loading, and saving.
